        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          As a part of my Full Stack Development course at CareerFoundry, I
          successfully developed a movie app over a span of four weeks.
          Leveraging an existing REST API and MongoDB database, I seamlessly
          integrated these components with REACT.js. The project was entirely
          driven by my efforts, as I personally authored all the code,
          incorporating valuable feedback provided by my tutor. Moreover, I
          meticulously designed the user interface, ensuring a polished and
          comprehensive user experience.

        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The goal was to meticulously construct a responsive and user-friendly
          web application utilizing the capabilities of React, seamlessly
          weaving it into the fabric of the pre-existing server-side framework
          comprised of a REST API and MongoDB database. Within this framework,
          the key aims encompassed the seamless presentation of movie lists,
          detailed movie insights, the seamless handling of user logins and
          profiles, and the implementation of a sophisticated mechanism to
          effortlessly manage users' favorite movies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="caseStudy_container">
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I started off by establishing an API database, inputting crucial movie
          data such as Titles, descriptions, directors, genres, and images.
          MongoDB emerged as the ideal database choice, aligning well with the
          project's needs. <br />Next, I delved into the technology selection
          process, considering React, Angular, and Vue.js. My analysis led me to
          opt for React, given its seamless compatibility and suitability for
          the project's objectives. <br />With the groundwork set, I embarked on
          building the React application. I employed JavaScript and React
          components to meticulously create distinct views for login, signup,
          movie details, and profiles, ensuring a comprehensive user experience.
          <br />
          To optimize user engagement, I implemented forms, harnessed Bootstrap
          for consistent styling, and incorporated app routing to ensure smooth
          navigation throughout the application.<br />
          As the project drew to a close, I turned my attention to aesthetics.
          Drawing inspiration from the ambiance of movie theaters, I curated a
          color scheme featuring black and maroon hues. The final touches were
          refined through the adept use of CSS and Bootstrap, guaranteeing a
          visually appealing and seamlessly responsive experience across various
          devices.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          I encountered a significant hurdle during the User Info Update
          process, where changes to user information failed to process upon
          submission. To overcome this issue, I engaged in meticulous debugging
          and conducted an exhaustive code review.
          <br />Another noteworthy challenge emerged with Account Deletion, as
          the deletion process encountered an obstacle. Through diligent
          investigation, I identified and swiftly resolved the account deletion
          roadblock by rectifying a URL parameter case, resulting in a seamless
          user account removal experience. <br />The most formidable obstacle I
          faced was with Favorites Management. Saving a movie proved to be a
          repetitive task, often requiring multiple attempts. Additionally,
          removing a movie from Favorites became impossible after a failed
          initial attempt. In response, I devised an innovative solution by
          introducing a new backend endpoint specifically designed for movie
          deletion. This strategic move optimized data handling by modifying the
          GET favoriteMovies endpoint to exclusively retrieve movie IDs. This
          optimization streamlined data management, significantly enhancing
          overall performance.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Should I embark on a similar app-building journey in the future, I
          will prioritize the meticulous creation of endpoints, ensuring a
          better grasp from the outset. My experience has revealed that endpoint
          functionality posed the greatest challenge, impeding smooth operations
          as intended. This unforeseen hurdle necessitated my involvement in
          backend adjustments, diverting my focus from the frontend where it was
          intended.<br />However, the core facets that underpinned my design
          vision and functionality proved immensely successful, aligning
          seamlessly with my initial vision. This aspect remains unchanged and
          mirrors my original intent, signifying a gratifying achievement.
          <br />The invaluable lesson I gleaned from this endeavor is the
          profound significance of mastering endpoints. This understanding was
          not without its challenges, yet I am profoundly appreciative of the
          opportunity to deepen my proficiency with React. This undertaking
          broadened my skills and deepened my comprehension of endpoint
          intricacies, undoubtedly enhancing my future development endeavors.

        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>
          The duration of this project was double that of my average project,
          about four weeks total, due to the time spent debugging and adding
          additional endpoints.
