        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Achievement's project involved creating a basic To-Do List app
          using jQuery to practice and showcase our skills. The primary
          objective was to build a functional To-Do List application that
          allowed users to add, cross out, delete, and reorder items. As the
          lead developer for this project, I was responsible for making critical
          decisions about the project's structure and functionality.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role and Tasks</h3>
        <p>
          I served as the lead developer for this project, overseeing the entire
          development process. My tasks included setting up the project,
          creating the necessary file structure, implementing jQuery selectors
          and event listeners, and ensuring compatibility with various web
          browsers.
        </p>
        <h3>Decisions and Consequences</h3>
        <p>
          One of the key decisions I made was to use jQuery for this project,
          given its widespread popularity and versatility for DOM manipulation.
          This decision ensured that we could efficiently create and manage
          elements in the To-Do List. However, in hindsight, I believe I could
          have made the app more modern with additional design details, making
          it visually appealing. Additionally, including a feature to clear the
          input form after adding an item would have improved user experience.
        </p>
        <h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
        <p>
          If I could do things differently, I would consider enhancing the app's
          aesthetics and user interface. Modern design elements and animations
          could make the app more engaging. Moreover, I would prioritize
          implementing a form clearing mechanism after entering an item,
          streamlining the user workflow.
        </p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into working with
          libraries, particularly jQuery. I learned about the power of jQuery
          selectors and event handling, which significantly simplified DOM
          manipulation. This experience highlighted the importance of balancing
          functionality with user experience and design, something I will keep
          in mind for future projects.
