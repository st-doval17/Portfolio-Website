        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The "Meet" app is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA)
          built using React with a focus on test-driven development (TDD). This
          application leverages the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming
          events. The goal is to provide users with a reliable, feature-rich,
          and visually appealing tool for discovering events in their desired
          city.
        </p>
        <h3>Role and Tasks</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, I served as the lead developer, responsible for
          making critical design decisions and overseeing the development
          process.
        </p>
        <h4>My tasks included</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implementing the serverless architecture, ensuring backend
            scalability and reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Utilizing a TDD approach to write tests before actual code,
            resulting in higher code quality.
          </li>
          <li>Integrating the Google Calendar API for event data retrieval.</li>
          <li>
            Designing and implementing features such as event filtering by city,
            toggling event details, specifying the number of displayed events,
            and providing offline access.
          </li>
          <li>Creating an app shortcut for users' convenience.</li>
          <li>
            Incorporating data visualization through charts to enhance the user
            experience and make event information more accessible.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Decisions Made and Consequences</h3>
        <p>
          Several crucial decisions were made to ensure the success of the
          project.
        </p>
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the project, there are areas where I would consider
          making improvements if given the opportunity to revisit it. First and
          foremost, I would focus on enhancing the user interface to make it
          more visually appealing and intuitive. A more modern and user-friendly
          design could significantly enhance the overall user experience.
          Furthermore, I would explore additional features and functionalities
          to make the chat app even more versatile. These could include message
          search, message reactions, and improved notification handling.
        </p>
        <h4>These decisions include</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adopting a serverless architecture to eliminate backend maintenance,
            enhance scalability, and reduce costs during idle times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Embracing PWAs to deliver a seamless user experience, including
            instant loading, offline support, and cross-platform compatibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prioritizing a TDD approach to focus on clear requirements before
            diving into coding, leading to robust and well-tested functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the Google Calendar API for accurate and up-to-date event data
            retrieval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementing responsive design to accommodate various screen sizes
            and passing Lighthouse's PWA checklist to ensure high performance
            and reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enabling offline functionality with a service worker and allowing
            users to add the app to their home screens for quick access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorporating data visualization, including charts, to present event
            information more effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Potential Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          In retrospect, if given the opportunity to revisit the project, I
          would consider enhancing its visual aesthetics to create a more modern
          and sleek appearance. This would involve refining the user interface
          and user experience design to align with contemporary standards.
          Additionally, I would explore additional data visualization techniques
          and options to provide users with more insights and interactivity.
        </p>
        <h3>Role & Accomplishments</h3>
        <p>
          I served as the lead developer for this project, successfully meeting
          all the specified requirements and implementing my design vision.
          Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights into the
          significance of well-defined endpoints and the intricacies of back-end
          development.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          Through this project, I gained valuable experience in implementing
          serverless architecture, PWAs, and test-driven development. Learning
          to work with the Google Calendar API expanded my skills in handling
          external data sources. Moreover, this project underscored the
          significance of ensuring compatibility with a wide range of browsers,
          including older ones, and the importance of thorough testing and
          monitoring to maintain a high-quality web application.
